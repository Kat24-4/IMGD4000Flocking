# IMGD4000: Flocking Project 

## Getting Started
I started by following the in-class set-up tutorial. 
I then followed the first link on the assignment to implement the Boids Algorithm. 

## About this Project
I was able to implemented the three main rules of the Boids Algorithm. 
I was also able to successfully implement the speed limitation tweak. 
I attempted to implement both the tend to place tweak and the bounding tweak, but I did not have enough time to polish these tweaks.
I chose to leave the code in the project, but it is not being used.
